# Lattice OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for the Lattice API.

The specification serves as a reference for interacting with the Lattice APIs
via HTTP+JSON. If you prefer to use client-generated SDKs in the language of 
your choice, you may follow the [Generate HTTP SDKs](https://docs.anduril.com/guide/generate-http-sdks)
guide on our documentation site.
